Data Structures
===============

struct data {
    int type; //1
    int index;
    int payload_len;
    char* payload[1200 - 3*sizeof(int)];
}

struct ack {
    int type; //2
    int index;
}

struct finished {
    int type; //3
}

Client and server maintain arrays to store packet index number, payload_len and payloads of size ARRAY_SIZE.
When client receives an ack, it zeros those values and tries to move ack up.  Client refills arrays when
